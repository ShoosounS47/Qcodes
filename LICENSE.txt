Qcodes is currently a private development of Microsoft's Station Q
collaboration, and IS NOT licensed for distribution outside the collaboration.
We intend to release it as open source software once it is robust and reasonably
stable under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) or similar,
so that Qcodes may be used freely and incorporated into other packages, even if they
are closed source.
